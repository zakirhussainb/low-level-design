## Problem Statement

### We have to do low level design for a Cache System. Cache that we will design must support 3 operations :
* Put : This will allow user to put a value against a key in the cache.
* Get : This will allow user to get the previously saved value using key.
* Eviction : Cache should also support removal of some key in case the cache is full when we try to add new key value.

### Expectations
* Code should be functionally correct.
* Code should be modular and readable. Clean and professional level code.
* Code should be extensible and scalable. Means it must be able to accommodate new requirements with minimal changes.
* Code should have good OOPs design.
